# Loss Analysis
1.loss_classifier:
    
* The high spike in epoch 2 suggests the model is struggling with classifying objects accurately.
  Possible Causes:
  Imbalanced classes: If you have far fewer images for certain classes, the model might overfit to dominant classes.
  Insufficient data: If thereâ€™s not enough training data per class, the model might not generalize well.
2. loss_box_reg:
   * This loss measures how well the predicted bounding boxes align with the ground truth.
   It starts reasonably low, which is good, and continues to stabilize.
  
3. loss_mask:
   * This is the highest contributor to the total loss during the earlier epochs.
   * Possible Causes:
     * Inaccurate masks: If the masks are noisy or incorrectly labeled, it can confuse the model.
     * Complex backgrounds: If objects blend too much into the background, the model might struggle to differentiate.

4. loss_objectness:
   * This measures how confident the model is about the presence of objects in anchor boxes.
   * The low and stable values here suggest that the object detection portion of the RPN is performing reasonably well.
   loss_rpn_box_reg:

The region proposal network (RPN) is doing a decent job at identifying regions of interest since this loss is relatively low.
